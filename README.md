Phase 0: Initial Redis Project
Phase 0 of this database project aims to provide students with a basic understanding of a simple data management system called Redis. Using Java, participants will write programs that connect to the Redis data management system, enabling them to store and retrieve information. The program will initially load data from a CSV file, provided as an attachment, into the Redis database. Subsequently, it will accept commands through a CLI interface, process them according to the specified format, and perform necessary changes on the database content. The accuracy of the program's output will be verified through script-based testing, and adherence to the specified input/output formats is crucial for successful evaluations. Redis is an open-source data management system that stores data in the RAM for faster read/write access, making it suitable for temporary caching and database optimization.
